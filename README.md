## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 10

## Self-Reflection:
This assignment was very helpful for what I am moving into at work. This summer I am joining a team to help me learn about testing and I was glad I got to do some here.
I think the cypress suite is very intuitive. Learning how to gather data from the html code and test the application by dynamically injecting text makes sense.
The jtests also made a lot of sense for unit testing. I think it will be hard for me to figure out how to start the tests but once I know what I am supposed to be doing it won't be too difficult.


### How long it took me to finish this?
2 hours, cypress took its time installing.
